Objective: Use the letters given to create as many words from the english
		language as possible.

Gameplay: The very moment the program is opened, a timer begins to count down.
		While the timer counts down from 30 seconds. The user types a word,
		then presses enter. If the word is present on the screen, and
		it is confirmed in the dictionary, the score is raied by one point.
		If the word entered is not valid, nothing happens and the timer 
		continues to count down.

Players: Currently, the game is designed for a single player. However, a couple
		can take turns and compete for the best score.

Notes: When the timer reaches zero, the program displays the final score
		and gives the user a chance to play again.

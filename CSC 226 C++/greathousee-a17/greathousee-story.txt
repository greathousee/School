Dear [0 "person"],

One day, I would like to live in [1 "place"], spending the rest of my life with you. We could sit in [2 "adjective"] rocking chairs, watching [3 "noun"] [4 "verb in present participle"]. I want you to know that you look [5 "adverb"], and I hope you feel the same. [0], you complete me.
Love,
[6 "person"]
